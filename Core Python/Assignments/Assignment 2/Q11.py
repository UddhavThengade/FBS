#11. Write a program to accept an integer amount from user and tell minimum number of notes needed for representing that amount.

amount = int(input('Enter The Amount : '))
n500 = amount//500
amount = amount%500
n200 = amount//200
amount = amount%200
n100 = amount//100
amount = amount%100
n50 = amount//50
amount = amount%50
n20 = amount//20
amount = amount%20
n10 = amount//10
amount = amount%10
n5 = amount//5
amount = amount%5
n2 = amount//2
amount = amount%2
n1 = amount//1
amount = amount%1
n1 = amount

print('500 note = ',n500)
print('200 note = ',n200)
print('100 note = ',n100)
print('50 note = ',n50)
print('20 note = ',n20)
print('10 note = ',n10)
print('5 note = ',n5)
print('2 note = ',n2)
print('1 note = ',n1)
